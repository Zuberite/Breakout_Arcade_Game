Grade 11 Final Project Based on Breakout Arcade Game.

Instructions on how to run

1. Download the zip File and extract the files to a folder
2. Download Visual Studio Code and Install the Pygame Add-on Through Visual Studio Code (There should only be one Option, else choose the first one)
3. Run the SubbayalYusufBreakoutVersion5 File in Visuel Studio Code

Video:

If you are unable to run the game, that's ok! I have included a video below for you to watch instead. (Video to be added Sepetember 21, 2021 in the morning)

I'd love any feedback on my game or what I could have done better for next time!

Thank you! - Subbayal Yusuf
